          Derby Arts and Theatre Association (DATA) administers the Diary
          Scheme, a mutual aid arrangement for amateur theatre and music
          societies in the Derby area. It has been operating since DATA was
          founded in 1986 (see our <a href="[% conf.root %]about_us">About
          Us</a> page).

<p>
  Member societies, of which there are currently [% societies.size %], may list
  the events that they stage on this website, which is provided and maintained
  by DATA. Member societies pay a small fee to cover DATA's costs (currently
  &pound;10 for two years' subscription).

        <p>
          Each member society must appoint at least one person to liaise with
          the Diary Scheme's organisers. The majority of communication is by
          e-mail. Member society representatives should advise the Diary Scheme
          organisers of their future plans as early as possible by one of the
          following means:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Via e-mail to <a href="mailto:admin@derbyartsandtheatre.org.uk">
            admin@derbyartsandtheatre.org.uk</a>;
          </li>
          <li>
            By using the <a href="[% conf.root %]notify_event">Notify Us</a>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">(of events)</span> page;
          </li>
          <li>
            Via our recommended method, which is to <a
            href="[% conf.root %]account/begin_registration">Register</a> a user
            account with us, which you can then use to directly add events
            to our website.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Member societies are encouraged to use the list as a planning aid to
          avoid duplication of events or clashes of dates. Events can be added
          as placeholders to make them visible to other member societies without
          being published to the public for this purpose. However, there is no
          control by DATA over member societies' plans.
        </p>

        <p>
          Published events are made visible on this website where they can be
          seen by the public and are also then publicised via a number of other
          means, see "Publicity via the DATA Diary" <span
          class="hide-for-medium">(below)</span><span
          class="show-for-medium">(right)</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          DATA and the Diary Scheme organisers accept no liability for any
          errors, howsoever caused.
