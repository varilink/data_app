# DATA - App

## Perl Code Documentation

Documentation of all the Perl code used by this web application, which is contained in the the `pl/`, `pm/` and `psgi` directories. This documentation is automatically generated using the `pod2markdown` command to produce Markdown from the Perl Plain Old Documentation (POD) format text that is embedded within the code itself. The [DATA - Docker](https://github.com/varilink/data_docker/tree/main) repository provides a Docker Compose service for regenerating this documentation.
